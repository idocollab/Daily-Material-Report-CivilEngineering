# Daily Site Material Logger

This repository contains Python scripts created for **learning, revision, and structured practice** while modeling a simple site engineering workflow.

## Scripts

### 1. Log Site Materials (`log_site_materials.py`)
- Records daily material usage (cement, sand, aggregate)
- Calculates individual material costs and total cost
- Saves the data to a CSV file (`data.csv`)
- Uses helper utilities for input handling, logging setup, and screen clearing

### 2. Analyze Site Materials (`analyze_site_materials.py`)
- Reads the CSV data generated by `log_site_materials.py`
- Prints a summary including:
  - Total days logged
  - Total material used (cement, sand, aggregate)
  - Total and average costs

## Notes
- Both scripts are structured for learning and experience, **not production-ready**
- Uses classes and basic modules to practice OOP, CSV handling, and structured problem-solving
