# Daily Site Material Logger

A small Python CLI project created for revision and learning.  
It models a simple site engineering workflow by logging daily material usage (cement, sand, aggregate), calculating costs, and saving records to a CSV file.

This project is intended for practicing OOP, CSV file handling, input validation, and structured problem-solving, not as a production-ready site tool.
